This setup allows you to follow along on Zoom while also doing the hands-on coding.\n\n## Installing R\n\n* Install the latest version from: [https://posit.co/](https://posit.co/)\n\n* [Install RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)\n\nRStudio is an **integrated development environment** (IDE) that makes it easier to work with R.\n\nMore on that soon!\n\n\n## Basic terms\n\nR jargon: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-1-4419-1318-0%2F1.pdf\n\n**Package** - a package in R is a bundle or \"package\" of code (and or possibly data) that can be loaded together for easy repeated use or for **sharing** with others.\n\nPackages are sort of analogous to a software application like Microsoft Word on your computer. Your operating system allows you to use it, just like having R installed (and other required packages) allows you to use packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/hex.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='R hex stickers for packages' width=35%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Function** - a function is a particular piece of code that allows you to do something in R. You can write your own, use functions that come directly from installing R, or use functions from additional packages.\n\nA function might help you add numbers together, create a plot, or organize your data. More on that soon!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(1, 20234)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 20235\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n **Argument** - what you pass to a function\n\n- can be data like the number 1 or 20234 \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(1, 20234)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 20235\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- can be options about how you want the function to work such as `digits`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nround(0.627, digits = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.63\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nround(0.627, digits = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.6\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Object** - an object is something that can be worked with in R - can be lots of different things!\n\n- a matrix of numbers\n- a plot\n- a function\n\n... many more\n\n## Variable and Sample\n\n- **Variable**: something measured or counted that is a characteristic about a sample\n\nexamples: temperature, length, count, color, category\n\n- **Sample**: individuals that you have data about -\n\nexamples: people, houses, viruses etc.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(iris)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Columns and Rows\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://keydifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rows-vs-column.jpg){fig-align='center' fig-alt='R hex stickers for packages' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n[[source](https://keydifferences.com/difference-between-rows-and-columns.html)]\n\nSample = Row  \nVariable = Column\n\nData objects that looks like this is often called a **data frame**.\n\nFancier versions from the tidyverse are called **tibbles** (more on that soon!).\n\n\n## More on Functions and Packages\n\n* When you download R, it has a \"base\" set of functions/packages (**base R**)  \n    * You can install additional packages for your uses from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/) \n    * These additional packages are written by RStudio or R users/developers (like us)  \n    \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/hex.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Picture of R package stickers' width=30%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Using Packages\n\n* Not all packages available on CRAN or GitHub are trustworthy\n* RStudio (the company) makes a lot of great packages\n* Who wrote it? **Hadley Wickham** is a major authority on R (Employee and Developer at RStudio)\n* How to [trust](http://simplystatistics.org/2015/11/06/how-i-decide-when-to-trust-an-r-package/) an R package\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/905186381995147264/7zKAG5sY_400x400.jpg){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Picture of Hadley Wickham' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n(source: https://twitter.com/hadleywickham)\n\n## Tidyverse and Base R\n\nWe will mostly show you how to use tidyverse packages and functions. \n\nThis is a newer set of packages designed for data science that can make your code more **intuitive** as compared to the original older Base R.\n\n**Tidyverse advantages**:  \n - **consistent structure** - making it easier to learn how to use different packages  \n - particularly good for **wrangling** (manipulating, cleaning, joining) data  \n - more flexible for **visualizing** data  \n\nPackages for the tidyverse are managed by a team of respected data scientists at RStudio.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/logo.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Tidyverse hex sticker' width=10%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSee this [article](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/paper.html) for more info.\n\n\n## Collection of R packages\n\n\n# Installation and use\n\n* Install all the packages in the tidyverse by running `install.packages(\"tidyverse\")`.\n\n* Run `library(tidyverse)` to load the core tidyverse and make it available\n  in your current R session.\n\nLearn more about the tidyverse package at <https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org>.\n\n## Core tidyverse\n\nThe core tidyverse includes the packages that you're likely to use in everyday data analyses. As of tidyverse 1.3.0, the following packages are included in the core tidyverse:\n\n\n{{< packages-hex >}}\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse also includes many other packages with more specialised usage. They are not loaded automatically with `library(tidyverse)`, so you'll need to load each one with its own call to `library()`.\n\n## Import\n\nAs well as [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org), for reading flat files, the tidyverse package installs a number of other packages for reading data:\n\n* [DBI](https://github.com/rstats-db/DBI) for relational databases.\n  (Maintained by [Kirill Müller](https://www.cynkra.com).)\n  You'll need to pair DBI with a database specific backends like \n  [RSQLite](https://rsqlite.r-dbi.org), \n  [RMariaDB](https://rmariadb.r-dbi.org),\n  [RPostgres](https://rpostgres.r-dbi.org), or \n  [odbc](https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc). \n  Learn more at <https://db.rstudio.com>.\n\n* [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org) for SPSS, Stata, and SAS data.\n\n* [httr](https://github.com/r-lib/httr) for web APIs.\n\n* [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org) for `.xls` and `.xlsx` sheets.\n\n* [rvest](https://github.com/tidyverse/rvest) for web scraping.\n\n* [jsonlite](https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite#jsonlite)\n  for JSON. (Maintained by [Jeroen Ooms](https://github.com/jeroen).)\n\n* [xml2](https://github.com/r-lib/xml2) for XML.\n\n## Wrangle\n\nIn addition to [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org), and [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), there are five packages (including [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org) and [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org)) which are designed to work with specific types of data:\n\n* [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org) for dates and date-times.\n* [hms](https://github.com/tidyverse/hms) for time-of-day values.\n* [blob](https://github.com/tidyverse/blob) for storing blob (binary) data.\n\n## Program\n\nIn addition to [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org), which provides very consistent and natural methods for iterating on R objects, there are two additional tidyverse packages that help with general programming challenges:\n\n* [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org) provides the pipe, `%>%` used\n  throughout the tidyverse. It also provide a number of more specialised\n  piping operators (like `%$%` and `%<>%`) that can be useful in other places.\n\n* [glue](https://github.com/tidyverse/glue) provides an alternative to\n  `paste()` that makes it easier to combine data and strings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote it may take ~5-10 minutes to run.\n\n## Useful (+ mostly Free) Resources\n\nFound on our website under the `Resources` tab:\nhttps://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/resources.html\n\n-  videos from previous offerings of the class\n-  cheatsheets from the class \n\n## Useful (+ mostly Free) Resources\n\n**Want more?**  \n\n- Tidyverse Skills for Data Science Book: https://jhudatascience.org/tidyversecourse/ \n(more about the tidyverse, some modeling, and machine learning)\n\n- Tidyverse Skills for Data Science Course: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tidyverse-data-science-r  \n(same content with quizzes, can get certificate with $)\n\n- R for Data Science: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/  \n(great general information)\n\n- R basics by Rafael A.
