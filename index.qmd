# Overview

This course is designed to introduce students to the use of R/Bioconductor for bioinformatics data analysis. R/Bioconductor is a popular open-source programming language and environment used for statistical computing and graphics, specifically for the analysis of biological data. The course will cover the basics of R programming language and its applications to bioinformatics, including the use of Bioconductor packages for analysis of high-throughput sequencing data, gene expression data, and proteomics data.

Students will learn how to perform exploratory data analysis, visualization, quality control, and statistical analysis using R/Bioconductor packages. Topics covered will include data import and export, data manipulation and transformation, normalization, differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and pathway analysis. The course will also provide an introduction to machine learning techniques for bioinformatics analysis.

Throughout the course, students will apply their knowledge through practical exercises and projects. By the end of the course, students will have a good understanding of R/Bioconductor and be able to apply it to their own bioinformatics research projects.

## What is R?

R is an open source language and environment for statistical computing, data mining, modeling, and data graphics. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques such as linear and non-linear modeling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, and clustering.



## What is Bioconductor?

Bioconductor is an open-source, open-development software project for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data, primarily focused on the R programming language. Bioconductor provides a wide range of tools for the analysis and interpretation of high-throughput genomic data, including microarrays, next-generation sequencing data, proteomics data, and other genomic data types.

Bioconductor consists of a collection of packages that are designed for specific genomic data analysis tasks, such as normalization, differential gene expression analysis, pathway analysis, visualization, and machine learning. The packages are regularly updated and maintained by a large and active community of developers and users.

Bioconductor also provides an extensive documentation, including tutorials, vignettes, and manuals, to help users get started with the software and to guide them through the analysis process.

In summary, Bioconductor is an essential resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of genomics and bioinformatics, providing a powerful and flexible platform for the analysis and interpretation of genomic data.

- Apply machine learning techniques, such as random forests, support vector machines, and principal component analysis, for the analysis of genomic data

**6. Design and implement a bioinformatics research project using R/Bioconductor**

- Understand the steps involved in designing and implementing a bioinformatics research project
- Identify and formulate a research question that can be answered using genomic data analysis
- Collect and preprocess the required genomic data
- Perform the required genomic data analysis using R/Bioconductor packages
- Interpret and visualize the results of genomic data analysis
- Communicate the findings of genomic data analysis effectively in written and oral formats.

## Why R?

-   R is a programming and statistical language.
-   R is used for data Analysis and Visualization.
-   R is simple and easy to learn, read and write.
-   R is an example of a FLOSS (Free Libre and Open Source Software) where one can freely distribute copies of this software, read its source code, modify it, etc.


## Useful resources for learning R




- **DataCamp:** interactive online lessons in R.

    -   Some of the courses are free (particularly community-written lessons like the one you'll do today), but for paid courses, DataCamp costs about 300 SEK / mo.

-   **RStudio Cheat Sheets:** Very helpful 1-2 page overviews of common tasks and packages in R.

-   **Quick-R:** Website with short example-driven overviews of R functionality.

-   **StackOverflow:** Part of the Stack Exchange network, StackOverflow is a Q&A community website for people who work in programming. Tons of incredibly good R users and developers interact on StackExchange, so it's a great place to search for answers to your questions.

-   **R-Bloggers:** Blog aggregagator for posts about R. Great place to learn really cool things you can do in R.

-   **R for Data Science:** Online version of the book by Hadley Wickham, who has written many of the best packages for R, including the Tidyverse, which we will cover.

## Textbook

-   Wickham, H. & Grolemund, G. (2018). for Data Science. O'Reilly: New York. Available for free at <http://r4ds.had.co.nz> (FREE)

-   Sosulski, K. (2018). R Fundamentals. Bookdown: New York. Available at: <http://becomingvisual.com/rfundamentals> (FREE)

## Required software

-   R: <http://www.r-project.org/> (FREE)

## Recording of classes

Class lectures will be recorded automatically using cloud. The links will be posted to CHIRAL Classes when they are available.

## Is this course for me?

If your answer to any of the following questions is "yes", then this is the right workshop for you.

-   Do you make summary tables in R (data, survey data, regression models, time-to-event data, adverse event reports)?

-   Do you want your workflow to be reproducible?

-   Are you often frustrated with the immense amount of code required to create great-looking tables in R?

The workshop is designed for those with some experience in R. It will be expected that you can perform basic data manipulation. Experience with the {tidyverse} and the `%>%` operator is a plus, but not required.

## Prework

Before attending the workshop please have the following installed and configured on your machine.

-   Recent version of **R**

-   Recent version of **RStudio**

-   Most recent release of the [**Bioconductor**](https://www.bioconductor.org/install/) and other packages used in courses

Install the latest release of R, then get the latest version of Bioconductor by starting R and entering the commands. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.16")
```

- Ensure you can knit R markdown documents

    -   Open RStudio and create a new Rmarkdown document
    -   Save the document and check you are able to knit it.

## Install Bioconductor Packages
```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()
```

Install specific packages, e.g., ‚ÄúGenomicFeatures‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnnotationDbi‚Äù, with


```{r, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install(c("GenomicFeatures", "AnnotationDbi"))
```

The install() function (in the BiocManager package) has arguments that change its default behavior; type ?install for further help.

## Zoom + Working Virtually
